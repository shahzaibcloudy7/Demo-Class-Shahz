        <p>This is my first page on:</p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahada">"The Shahada (Arabic: ٱلشَّهَادَةُ aš-šahādah - "the testimony")</a>
        <h2> لا إله إلا الله محمد رسول الله (lā ʾilāha ʾillallāh, Muḥammad rasūlu-llāh) (in Arabic) There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is his messenger. ( in English)</h2>
